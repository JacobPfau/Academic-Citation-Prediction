Features:

recompute with k=1000 for citation check
compute edges for large number of 'other' pairs
normalize for variance (doesn't seem to have big effect on peer popularity)

NOTES:
By error overlap determined that max sim and citation check with ngrams vs single words negligible difference
tested raw LSA vector pairs as input to classifying perceptron failed (similarly supervised tfidf weighting by discriminatory capacity of terms performs <1% better according to pepper)
polynomial features didn't work
journal % citations didn't workv
